Overview
========

This pipeline runs sylamer on input fasta file for a list of given miRNA seeds.

files :file:``pipeline.yml` and :file:`conf.py`.

Usage
=====

See :ref:`PipelineSettingUp` and :ref:`PipelineRunning` on general
information how to use CGAT pipelines.

Configuration
-------------

The pipeline requires a configured :file:`pipeline.yml` file.
CGATReport report requires a :file:`conf.py` and optionally a
:file:`cgatreport.ini` file (see :ref:`PipelineReporting`).

Default configuration files can be generated by executing:

   python <srcdir>/pipeline_sylamer.py config

Input files
-----------

- fasta file of 3'UTRs of mRNAs to look for miRNA seeds
- list of miRNA seeds to look for 
- ranked list for each mRNA present in the fasta file

Requirements
------------

On top of the default CGAT setup, the pipeline requires the following
software to be installed and in the path:
    - GSL library and sylamer


/!\Sylamer needs GSL to run 
On stanage: module load GSL/2.7-GCC-12.2.0

Pipeline output
===============

- directories for each seed before running sylamer on each
- output directories with sylamer results for each miRNA seed present in input list of seeds
